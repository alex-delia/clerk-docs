description: Learn about Clerk's Maintenance Mode.
---

Once or twice per year, Clerk needs to undergo maintenance on it's infrastructure and will enter **Maintenance Mode**. During this time period, active users will not be affected, however new sign-ups, sign-ins and user mutations will return an error.  We a special operational state designed to ensure minimal disruption to signed-in users during critical database upgrades or outages.

This mode will deprecated in 2025 as we upgrade our infrastructure.

## Production instances

Mutation methods (`POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) will be rejected with a `SystemUnderMaintenance` error. This includes all new sign-up's and sign-in's.

Active sessions, and session refresh requests **are not** affected. This includes, `GET` requests, as well as session refresh requests ([`/touch`](/docs/reference/frontend-api/tag/Sessions#operation/touchSession) and [`/tokens`](/docs/reference/frontend-api/tag/Sessions#operation/createSessionToken) endpoints). Users who are already signed in will not be signed out, and will continue to have access to your app. However, any mutations to their user or org data will return the same `SystemUnderMaintenance` error.

### API errors

All mutations from both the Frontend API and the Backend API will return the following error.

`SystemUnderMaintenance`

```json
// 503 StatusServiceUnavailable
{
  "shortMessage": "System under maintenance",
  "longMessage": "We are currently undergoing maintenance and only essential operations are permitted. We will be back shortly.",
  "code": "maintenance_mode"
}
```

### UI Components

During the maintenance period, Clerk's UI components will display the following error for sign-in's, sign-up's, and all user/org mutations.
