<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/nuxt`

  Clerk's Nuxt SDK gives you access to prebuilt components, Vue composables, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn",  "pnpm" ]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/nuxt
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/nuxt
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/nuxt
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
    1. Paste your key into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  NUXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ### Update `nuxt.config.ts`

  To enable Clerk in your Nuxt app, add `@clerk/nuxt` to your modules array in `nuxt.config.ts`.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'nuxt.config.ts', mark: [2] }}
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: ['@clerk/nuxt'],
  })
  ```

  ### Protect your pages

  #### Client-side

  To protect your pages on the client-side, you can use Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/components/overview#what-are-control-components) that control the visibility of content based on the user's authentication state.

  The following example uses the following components:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button): Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page or displays the sign-in modal.

  ```vue {{ filename: 'pages/index.vue' }}
  <template>
    <div>
      <h1>Index Route</h1>
      <SignedIn>
        <p>You are signed in</p>
        <UserButton />
      </SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>
        <p>You are signed out</p>
        <SignInButton />
      </SignedOut>
    </div>
  </template>
  ```

  #### Server-side

  To protect your API routes, use the `event.context.auth` object in your event handlers. This object contains the `Auth` object that includes the `userId`, allowing you to determine if the user is authenticated.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'server/api/user.ts' }}
  export default eventHandler((event) => {
    const { userId } = event.context.auth

    if (!userId) {
      throw createError({
        statusCode: 401,
        statusMessage: 'Unauthorized',
      })
    }

    return { userId }
  })
  ```

  ### Create your first user

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your app's homepage at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). Sign up to create your first user.
