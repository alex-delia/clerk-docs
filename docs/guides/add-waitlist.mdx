title: Waitlist and Next.js Quickstart
description: Learn how to add a waitlist to your application.
---

In [**Waitlist** mode](/docs/authentication/restrictions#waitlist), users can register their interest in your app by joining a waitlist. This mode is ideal for apps in early development stages or those wanting to generate interest before launch. This guide shows you how to get Clerk integrated and how to add a waitlist to your Next.js application.

<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/nextjs`

  Clerk's [Next.js SDK](/docs/references/nextjs/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, React hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/nextjs
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/nextjs
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/nextjs
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your Clerk API keys

  <If condition={experiment.enabled}>
    <ExperimentCreateAccountFromDocsQuickstart params={experiment} />
  </If>

  <If condition={!experiment.enabled}>
    <SignedIn>
      Add the following keys to your `.env.local` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.
    </SignedIn>

    <SignedOut>
      1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys){{ track: 'exp_create_account_nextjs_quickstart' }} page.
      1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
      1. Paste your keys into your `.env.local` file.

      The final result should resemble the following:
    </SignedOut>
  </If>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env.local' }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ### Enable Waitlist mode

  To enable **Waitlist** mode, follow these steps:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Restrictions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/restrictions) page.
  1. Under the **Sign-up modes** section, enable **Waitlist**.

  ### Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your app

  The [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component wraps your app to provide active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components. Before using the `<Waitlist />` component in your app, you must provide the `waitlistUrl` prop to `<ClerkProvider>`.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx', mark: [6] }}
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
  import './globals.css'

  export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    return (
      <ClerkProvider waitlistUrl="/waitlist">
        <html lang="en">
          <body>{children}</body>
        </html>
      </ClerkProvider>
    )
  }
  ```

  ### Add the `<Waitlist />` component

  The [`<Waitlist />`](/docs/components/waitlist) component renders a form that allows users to join for early access to your app.

  The following example includes a basic implementation of the `<Waitlist />` component hosted on the `/waitlist` route. You can use this as a starting point for your own implementation.

  ```jsx {{ filename: '/app/waitlist/[[...waitlist]]/page.tsx' }}
  import { Waitlist } from '@clerk/nextjs'

  export default function WaitlistPage() {
    return <Waitlist />
  }
  ```

  ### Manage waitlist entries

  To manage a user on your waitlist:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Waitlist**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=waitlist) page.
  1. On the right-side of the user's row, select the menu icon (...).
  1. Select **Invite** to invite the user to your application. Select **Deny** to deny the user access to your application.
</Steps>
