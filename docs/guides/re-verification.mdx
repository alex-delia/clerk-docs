description: Leverage Clerk‚Äôs utilities, to frequently ask users to verify their identity before sensitive actions are performed.
---


## Introduction

After a user has signed-in into your application, you may want to limit what they can access and control what actions they are allowed to perform based on how long the are logged in for.

For example, in a banking application, transferring money from one account to another is considered a ‚Äúsensitive action‚Äù and the end-user should be prompted to ‚Äúre-verify‚Äù their credentials before that sensitive action is completed.

Clerk offers a suite of utilities that helps you handle a re-verification flow.

- `auth().has()` now accepts a `reverification` attribute
- `useReverification()` is introduced to automatically prompt the end-user with a modal to reverify their credential and resume the sensitive action.

> This feature is currently on Public Beta.

## Caveats
There are a few things to consider, before you opt-in to this feature.
1. Not all factors are available to be used for re-verification. The available are:
    - First factors
        - Password
        - Email code
        - Phone code
    - Second Factors
        - Phone code
        - Authenticator app
        - Backup code
2. If a user does not have any of the above, they will not be able to re-verify their credentials and thus not be eligible to perform ‚Äúsensitive actions‚Äù.


## Wrap up

Your onboarding flow is now complete! üéâ Users who have not onboarded yet will now land on your `/onboarding` page. New users signing up or signing in to your application will have to complete the onboarding process before they can access your application. By using Clerk, you have streamlined the user authentication and onboarding process, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience for your new users.
