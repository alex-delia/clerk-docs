Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your Nuxt application. This documentation covers the capabilities and methods available from Clerk's Nuxt SDK.

## Guides

- [Read session and user data](/docs/references/nextjs/read-session-data)

## Client-side helpers

Because Clerk Nuxt is a wrapper around Clerk Vue, you can utilize the composables that Clerk Vue provides. These composables give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object, and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. You can learn more about these hooks [in the Vue SDK reference](/docs/references/vue/overview).

- [`useUser()`](/docs/references/vue/use-user)
- [`useClerk()`](/docs/references/vue/use-clerk)
- [`useAuth()`](/docs/references/vue/use-auth)
- [`useSignIn()`](/docs/references/vue/use-sign-in)
- [`useSignUp()`](/docs/references/vue/use-sign-up)
- [`useSession()`](/docs/references/vue/use-session)
- [`useSessionList()`](/docs/references/vue/use-session-list)
- [`useOrganization()`](/docs/references/vue/use-organization)

### `Auth` object

The `Auth` object is available at `event.context.auth` in your [event handlers](https://h3.unjs.io/guide/event-handler). This JavaScript object contains important information like session data, your user's ID, as well as their organization ID. Learn more about the `Auth` object [here](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object).

### `clerkMiddleware()`

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication and authorization into your Nuxt application through middleware. You can learn more [here](/docs/references/nuxt/clerk-middleware).
