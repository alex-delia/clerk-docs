title: Read session and user data in your Nuxt app with Clerk
description: Learn how to use Clerk's composables and helpers to access the active session and user data in your Nuxt application.
---

Clerk provides helpers that you can use to access the active session and user data in your Nuxt application.

## Server-side

The following example uses the `event.context.auth` object to validate an authenticated user and the [`clerkClient`](/docs/references/backend/overview) helper to get the full [`User`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-user) object.

```ts {{ filename: 'server/api/me.ts' }}
import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const { userId } = event.context.auth

  if (!userId) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 401,
      statusMessage: 'Unauthorized',
    })
  }

  const user = await clerkClient(event).users.get(userId)

  return user
})
```

## Client-side

### `useAuth()`

The `useAuth()` composable provides information about the current auth state, as well as helper methods to manage the current active session. The composable returns `userId`, which can be used to protect your pages.

```vue {{ filename: 'pages/example.vue' }}
<script setup>
const { userId } = useAuth()
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">Loading...</div>
  <div v-else-if="!userId">
    <!-- Do something if the user is not signed in -->
  </div>
  <div v-else>Hello, {{ userId }}!</div>
</template>
```

### `useUser()`

The `useUser()` composable provides the current user's [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user) object, which holds all of the information for a user of your application and provides a set of methods to manage their account.

```vue {{ filename: 'pages/example.vue' }}
<script setup>
const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser()
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">Loading...</div>
  <div v-else-if="!isSignedIn">
    <!-- Do something if the user is not signed in -->
  </div>
  <div v-else>Hello, {{ user.firstName }}!</div>
</template>
```
